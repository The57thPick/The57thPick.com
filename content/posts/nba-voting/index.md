The voting process for the NBA's most prestigious awards&mdash;such as *MVP*,
*DPOY*, and its *All-NBA Teams*&mdash;has always been fairly ill-defined
in terms of both *who* votes and *how* they voted. The rules have
[changed drastically][1] over the years and the full voting results weren't
even published until the 2015 season.

Since that 2015 season, the NBA has released the results as [PDF-formatted][3]
documents tabulated by Ernst &amp; Young LLP. And while this was certainly
a major step forward in transparency, the format isn't very useful for data
analysis.

I'm working on changing that.

## Why is this important?

In 2016, the NBA players and Board of Governors ratified a new
[Collective Bargaining Agreement][5]. This agreement included a
"designated player" exception that allows a team to sign one of its own
players to a five-year maximum contract extension, according to the
[following criteria][7]:

> 1. He makes one of the three all-NBA teams or is named either
        defensive player of the year or most valuable player the previous
        season.
> 2. He has made one of the three all-NBA teams or has been named
    defensive player of the year in two of the prior three seasons or
    the leagueâ€™s most valuable player in one of the three prior
    seasons.

This exception comes in addition to the well-known
"[Derrick Rose Rule][6]," which incentivizes making All-NBA teams
during a player's first four years. In response to the heightened
stakes of its media-based awards, the NBA also made a [few changes][4]
to its voter-selection process:

> 1. Decreased the number of eligible voters for each award from 130 to 100.
> 2. Limited the selection pool to "independent" media members (no
    radio/television broadcasters or writers associated with a
    particular team).
> 3. Required at least one voter per NBA market.

In total, the NBA's media-based awards have more meaning than ever and
understanding the process has become all the more important.

## Exploring the data

The NBA has 9 distinct media-chosen awards, each with its own number
of placements and scoring system (more on that later). The table below
summarizes each voter's ballot for a given award&mdash;Most Valuable
Player (`MVP`), Coach of the Year (`COY`), Rookie of the Year (`ROY`),
Defensive Player of the Year (`DPOY`), Most Improved Player (`MIP`),
6th Man of the Year (`6th`), All-NBA (`All-NBA`), All-Defense
(`All-Defensive`), and All-Rookie (`All-Rookie`).
